Dear all,

Please find newly generated system response curves in
http://home.fnal.gov/~wester/work/filter_curves.tar

This tar file has *.txt and *.dat files with equivalent information.
The file name encodes the filter type (n is for the None filter).
So, u_003.dat is for the u-Filter.

The files have 5 columns as follows:

(measured wavelength) (response) (response-radius1)(response-radius2)(response-radius3)(response-radius4)

where the (response) is photodiode and gain normalized ON-OFF reduced DECal data:
the average (over all relevant amplifiers)
of the median (over all the little boxes of 18 col x 25 rows that I divide up each amplifier)
of the truncated means (I only use the middle 68% of the pixels in each little box)
of the ON-OFF exposure divided by the photodiode 3 current 
and divided by a correction factor that is proportional to the gain of the amplifier.

I exclude amplifiers from non-science devices, ccdnum=61, and for the 10 CCD with 11 especially non-linear amplifiers. 
I also exclude data points where the measured wavelength has a fwhm >10nm.

(response) = average over all non-exluded amplifiers - you might look only at this column.

The other colums are separated by radius from an inner radius to an outer radius.
(response-radius1) = (response) averaged only for the inner two CCDs (<10% RMax)
(response-radius2) = (response) for 10<Rmax<30%
(response-radius3) = (response) for 30<Rmax<60%
(response-radius4) = (response) for Rmax>60%

The *.dat files should generally be used. 

The *.txt files are larger and are identical for all the filters. Each line corresponds to a wavelength. 
There are 405 lines from a center of 296 - 1104nm. If a measurement was not made then the entry for that 
wavelength is 0.000000. These might be useful, for reading in files with Excel or something and then 
dividing out filter data by no-Filter data.

Let me know if this makes sense,

William
